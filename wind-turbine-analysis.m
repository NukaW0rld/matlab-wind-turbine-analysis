% FUNCTION NAME:
%   AngleOfAttack
%
% PURPOSE:
%   Computes the relative wind speed magnitude (U_rel) and the angle of
%   attack (AoA) for a horizontal-axis wind turbine (HAWT) blade section.
%
% INPUT:
%   U - Wind velocity [m/s]
%   alpha - Axial induction factor [unitless]
%   alpha_p - Angular induction factor [unitless]
%   r - Radial position [m]
%   omega - Rotational velocity [rad/s]
%   theta_P - Section pitch angle [degrees]
%
% OUTPUT:
%   U_rel - Relative velocity magnitude [m/s]
%   AoA - Angle of attack [degrees]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% if length(theta_p)==1
%
U_axial = U * (1 - alpha); % Compute the axial component of the wind speed
U_tangential = omega * r * (1 + alpha_p); % Compute the tangential component of the wind speed
U_rel = sqrt(U_axial^2 + U_tangential.^2); % Compute the relative wind speed magnitude
psi = atan2(U_axial, U_tangential); % Compute the angle of the relative wind (phi) in radians
theta_P_rad = deg2rad(theta_P); % Convert the section pitch angle to radians
AoA_rad = psi - theta_P_rad; % Compute the angle of attack in radians
AoA=AoA_rad; % DEBUG - changed line - Convert the angle of attack to degrees
