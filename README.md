This MATLAB script is part of the Mechanical Modeling Project. It performs a comprehensive analysis of a wind turbine's performance, focusing on key parameters such as power output, efficiency, and aerodynamic behavior under varying wind conditions.

Features
* Calculates turbine power output based on input wind speeds
* Analyzes efficiency and performance factors
* Models aerodynamic forces and turbine dynamics

Usage
Run the script in MATLAB to simulate wind turbine performance. Modify input parameters within the script to adjust for different wind conditions or turbine configurations.
